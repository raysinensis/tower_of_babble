## Tower of Babble

https://francium34.itch.io/tower-of-babble

This is a personal year-end time off game jam product, a snapshot of my mindspace of this particular moment.

With a baby that has started to coo and babble, mostly nonsense but sometimes word-sounding noises. I had plenty of fun guessing / pretending what they are trying to say. But then, a thought popped in my mind, what if they are trying real hard to tell me something, and get frustrated that I wasn't understanding?

The premise of the game is: the player plays as the time-traveler now back in their baby form, trying to warn parents of impending danger, but limited by what pronunciations (random cards) they can piece together (blue text box in the images), as well as what parents would guess (black text box in the images. I'm using Gemini API to process syllables and natural language to assess if the word/phrase is harmless or suspicious). If the message doesn't get across in time (turns/rounds), the time-travel loops back again. Upon winning, the player can also play with a new twist: the parent will now try to guess words in Chinese as well (new game +).

The prototype is complete, compiles to iOS fine, but uploaded here with Gemini API key left out. I should note that this was a proof of concept for a narrative idea and an idea for use of generative AI chat, but I can't endorse burning energy to play this at any scale, and the Gemini API calls can be quite slow (screenshots are from model v3-preview which is very slow. It is fast on v2.5-lite, which is the default setting, but it's inaccurate and often doesn't respect output format requests), also capped to 20 calls per day on free accounts. To be clear, no code (all mine) or art assets (free) here are AI generated, but the reply dialogue is designed to be retrieving http calls.

Here's to a good 2026. Cheers.
